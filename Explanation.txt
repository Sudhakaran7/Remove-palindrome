You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.
Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.
A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.
Note: A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.
Constraint:0 <= s.length <= 1000
s only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'

Input Description:
A string S as an input.

Output Description:
Print the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

Sample Input:
abb

Sample Output:
2

Explanation:
Initially, the palindromic string a will get cancelled and then bb will get cancelled so we have done 2 operations to empty the string.

Sample Input:
aba

Sample Output:
1
